# ToDo


## backendstuff
deleteToLearnNote response is not the note

destructuring undefined maindata (like 'updatedToLearnNote' ) is handled poorly

make errorhandling and update test for resolvers schoolNoteos and sharedSchoolNotes

test for course and subject queries

test fro course and subject delete

tests for schoolNote query

noteCount property for course not always there

# dept
courseSelector dont think about courses that are in many subjects

can create notes on others courses. For now making everything to work pretty much only in best case scenaria, because need to know if it even works. after getting stuff to work need to start thinking about testing.

maybe find a way to use string ID:s to work better with grapghql (apollo)

maybe block making many subject with same name?

get subjects is questionable

there are no limitations to making to many notes retrieving to many and naming things to long

backend context authorizationg thing

mySubjects quey

add owner id to school note sharing table?

one place for error messages so they are consistent (backend)

# db stuff

unique tolearn_note course_id (and errorhandling for it in backend)

some kind of timestamp for added/last edited
