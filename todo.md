# ToDo

clean backend code, move databasecode to one place, make tests
(refining backend)

?? move unexpectedErrors file into resolvers folder

give some nice error when cant connect to db?

update frontend a bit before push to master

# dept
can create notes on others courses. For now making everything to work pretty much only in best case scenaria, because need to know if it even works. after getting stuff to work need to start thinking about testing.

maybe find a way to use string ID:s to work better with grapghql (apollo)

maybe block making many subject with same name?

get subjects is questionable

there are no limitations to making to many notes retrieving to many and naming things to long

backend context authorizationg thing

mySubjects quey

add owner id to school note sharing table?

one place for error messages so they are consistent (backend)

# db stuff

unique tolearn_note course_id (and errorhandling for it in backend)
