# dept
can create notes on others courses. For now making everything to work pretty much only in best case scenaria, because need to know if it even works. after getting stuff to work need to start thinking about testing.

maybe find a way to use string ID:s to work better with grapghql (apollo)

maybe block making many subject with same name?

get subjects is questionable

there are no limitations to making to many notes retrieving to many and naming things to long

backend context authorizationg thing

mySubjects quey

add owner id to school note sharing table?
