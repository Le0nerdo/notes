# ToDo

clean backend code, move databasecode to one place, make tests
(refining backend)

# dept
can create notes on others courses. For now making everything to work pretty much only in best case scenaria, because need to know if it even works. after getting stuff to work need to start thinking about testing.

maybe find a way to use string ID:s to work better with grapghql (apollo)

maybe block making many subject with same name?
